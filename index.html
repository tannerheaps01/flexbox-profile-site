                I grew up mostly in texas, but also lived in a few other states namely New Mexico Arizona and Utah. My family is pretty large I have three sisters and two brothers. I am the second oldest in my family. I went to Stony Point High School all four years and graduated in 2015. While in high school I ran a candy business and sold thousands of candy bars over my highschool career. My first real job was at a fast food place called Del Taco I worked there for a long time like a year and a half. I was a cashier slash janitor I had to take all  the orders from the drive through and I also had to clean the tables and the bathroom. My second job was as a dish washer at a food place conected to a bass pro shop called uncle bucks fish bowl and grill. After that I went on a mission for the church I used to go to I went to Twin Falls Idaho. I only went for a year, a normal mission is two years. Now I am working at a car wash and learning how to code at inventive university.
